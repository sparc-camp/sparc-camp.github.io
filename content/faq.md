### What is a typical day at SPARC like?
We have four to five hours of classes or activities each day, and an invited speaker many evenings. The rest of the time students generally relax, talk with each other and the instructors, or participate in optional activities.

Classes last about an hour and are taught in groups of 6-8 students. Most classes are discussion-based, though some are more traditional lectures and others are centered on exercises.

### What is taught at SPARC?
It’s easier to show than tell, but topics at SPARC include:
* Probability theory, information theory, the mathematics of rationality
* Fermi estimation, statistical street fighting, risk and power laws
* Microeconomics, prediction markets, game theory
* Effective communication, improvisation, posture, negotiation
* Regression, graphical models, causal modeling
* Motivation and intention, deliberate practice, cognitive biases

### How do I apply?
Applications will be available [here]({{"/apply/"}}). If you have any questions, feel free to email us at contact@sparc-camp.org.

### Should I apply to SPARC if I don’t know [X]?
Yes. The SPARC curriculum mostly requires curiosity, thoughtfulness, and a sharp mind. The mathematical requirement can be challenging but is not the basis for the entire application. Some classes are taught in several tracks to accommodate students’ varying backgrounds.

### How many people will be accepted?
SPARC will admit about 30 students.

### Who is eligible to apply?
You must be at least 14 years of age. You are welcome to apply if you are currently in high school or have not finished your first year as an undergraduate (i.e. college freshmen may apply). In general, we expect to mostly accept students who are in at least 11th grade of high school. Younger students are welcome to apply, but if you are not accepted this year, we encourage you to apply in future years.

If you do not meet these criteria but would still like to come, please e-mail us at contact@sparc-camp.org to discuss exceptions. International students are welcome.

### What grade reports, test scores, or recommendation letters will I need to apply for SPARC?
None! We create our own custom written application, which is followed by a short candidate interview if necessary.

### How much does the camp cost?
In order to attract the best students possible, SPARC is completely free. In particular, boarding and food are provided.

Need-based scholarships to cover the cost of travel are also available (you’ll have the chance to apply for one if you are admitted to SPARC).

### When and where will the camp be held?
SPARC 2020 will likely be held from July 28, 2020 to August 8, 2020 at California State University, East Bay.

### How is SPARC funded?
SPARC’s receives the majority of its funding from the [Open Philanthropy Project]({{"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about"}}):
