### What is a typical day at SPARC like?
We have four to five hours of classes or activities each day, and an invited speaker many evenings. The rest of the time students generally relax, talk with each other and the instructors, or participate in optional activities.

Classes last about an hour and are taught in groups of 6-8 students. Most classes are discussion-based, though some are more traditional lectures and others are centered on exercises.

### What is taught at SPARC?
It’s easier to show than tell, but topics at SPARC include:
* Probability theory, information theory, the mathematics of rationality
* Fermi estimation, statistical street fighting, risk and power laws
* Microeconomics, prediction markets, game theory
* Effective communication, improvisation, posture, negotiation
* Regression, graphical models, causal modeling
* Motivation and intention, deliberate practice, cognitive biases

### How do I apply?
Applications will be available [here]({{"/apply/"}}). If you have any questions, feel free to email us at contact@sparc-camp.org.

### Should I apply to SPARC if I don’t know [X]?
Yes. The SPARC curriculum mostly requires curiosity, thoughtfulness, and a sharp mind. The mathematical requirement can be challenging but is not the basis for the entire application. Some classes are taught in several tracks to accommodate students’ varying backgrounds.

### How many people will be accepted?
SPARC will admit about 30 students.

### Who is eligible to apply?
You must be at least 14 years of age. Historically, we only took high school students or students who had not yet spent a semester in college, but this past year we began experimenting with admitting college freshmen as well. The eligibility policy for SPARC 2019 will be finalized closer to when applications open in the winter.

If you do not meet these criteria but would still like to come, please e-mail us at contact@sparc-camp.org to discuss exceptions. International students are welcome.

### How much does the camp cost?
In order to attract the best students possible, SPARC is completely free. In particular, boarding and food are provided.

Need-based scholarships to cover the cost of travel are also available (you’ll have the chance to apply for one if you’re admitted to SPARC).

### When and where will the camp be held?
The exact dates and location of SPARC 2019 have not yet been finalized. SPARC 2018 was hosted at California State University, East Bay, and ran from July 22nd through August 3rd.

### How is SPARC funded?
SPARC’s receives the majority of its funding from the [Open Philanthropy Project]({{"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about"}}):
> The Open Philanthropy Project identifies outstanding giving opportunities, makes grants, follows the results, and publishes its findings. Its mission is to give as effectively as it can and share the findings openly so that anyone can build on them.
