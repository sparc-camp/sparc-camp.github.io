Hack Lodge is an immersive and intimate software development program for students. Teams spend a week working intensely on a software project of their choosing, with the ultimate goal of shipping a polished product by the end of the program. Participants come from a variety of technical backgrounds, from students with no formal engineering experience to experienced developers with years in industry.
