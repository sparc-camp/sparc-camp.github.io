SPARC offers capital for its alumni to pursue impactful projects. We think there are many great ideas out there with too few hands working on them, and we’d like to lower the financial barrier for taking action. If you are a SPARC alumni, you can [apply for a grant]({{"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VBd863FWkIYxnwOLFgio-IyINgTZKFruTdmpJGXsYRI/"}}) or read [our FAQ]({{"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EkBPRHep_EulB-HnfZ8FLLQBVW_tVMrJO874busQ-a8/"}}). Below are some of the projects we’ve sponsored.

### Hack Lodge

Hack Lodge is an immersive and intimate software development program for students. Teams spend a week working intensely on a software project of their choosing, with the ultimate goal of shipping a polished product by the end of the program. Participants come from a variety of technical backgrounds, from students with no formal engineering experience to experienced developers with years in industry.
