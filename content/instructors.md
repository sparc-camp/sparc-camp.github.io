        Andrew Critch received his PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley, where he specialized in algebraic statistics, and particularly its applications to machine learning and causal inference. He was awarded a three-year research faculty position at the NSF-sponsored Mathematical Biosciences Institute, but soon after decided to learn about the stock market and began working as an algorithmic trader for Jane Street Capital in New York. He loves thinking about causality, cognitive science, markets, and apparent philosophical paradoxes, and wants to convince you that free will and determinism are compatible. He also likes helping people to understand their goals and adopt new and productive habits.

        Chelsea Voss works as a software engineer for Pilot.com. She studied computer science with a minor in mathematics at MIT, and enjoys doing deep dives into complexity theory, type theory, and biochemistry. During her master’s thesis research, she learned how to apply logical inference with SMT solvers to problems in systems biology. In the past, she has worked at Wave.com and Khan Academy, taught as an instructor at USABO and USACO, presented computational biology research at the Intel STS, and competed on the USA teams to the International Biology Olympiad and International Linguistics Olympiad.
