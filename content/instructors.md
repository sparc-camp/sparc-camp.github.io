        <b>Chelsea Voss</b> works as a software engineer for Pilot.com. She studied computer science with a minor in mathematics at MIT, and enjoys doing deep dives into complexity theory, type theory, and biochemistry. During her master’s thesis research, she learned how to apply logical inference with SMT solvers to problems in systems biology. In the past, she has worked at Wave.com and Khan Academy, taught as an instructor at USABO and USACO, presented computational biology research at the Intel STS, and competed on the USA teams to the International Biology Olympiad and International Linguistics Olympiad.
